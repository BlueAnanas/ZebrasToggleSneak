    "description": "Sneak and sprint keys behave as if they can be locked into the pressed state and unlocked by pressing them again.\\nThe toggle function can be enabled/disabled ingame by pressing other configurable keys. Have a look into the Controls section.\\nSome extras:\\n + No toggle if key is pressed longer than key hold time\\n + Setting key hold time to 0 ticks will disable hold function\\n + No sneak toggle if dismounting or flying\\n + Flying speed can be boosted in creative mode by hitting the sprint key.\\n \\nA tip from BlauesZebra: Have a look at Shotbow's Minecraft servers at us.shotbow.net and eu.shotbow.net.\\nYou'll find this mod useful in all the great game modes there like Annihilation, MTA or MineZ\\nSee you at Shotbow soon!",
